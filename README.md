# Kiwi-webapp

This will be a community playlist for local use (for now), the host will be playing the music while the other users can send new musics to the queue. This is a side project i'm making to solve the issue of not knowing what to play next when we're at home with friends.

At first we'll be using ReactJS, to build this project, when we finish the MVP we'll be making it an real app for android.
